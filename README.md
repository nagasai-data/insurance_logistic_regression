# Insurance Claim Prediction 🔍🚗

This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a customer will opt for vehicle insurance based on features like age, gender, vehicle damage history, driving license, and annual premium.

## 🔍 What I did

- Explored and cleaned the dataset using `pandas`
- Converted categorical values using label encoding (`map`)
- Trained a **logistic regression model** using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Visualized results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🎯 Goal

To build a simple yet effective binary classification model that predicts customer interest in vehicle insurance. It demonstrates the power of logistic regression and good data preprocessing in solving real-world problems.
